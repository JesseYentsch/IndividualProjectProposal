Yarn is a node package manager available that allows developers to help share code with other developers.
It does so by being able to install and manage packages and dependencies. This helps create an easier way
for developers to get code that may already solve a problem they encounter. It enables a faster download of packages
and helps to remove security vulnerabilities using npm package installer. It also helps to make a more readable 
information when downloading a package. One way it enhances speed is by using an offline cache. It stores the package
so when installing or updating the package it can utilize this cache.

This project relates to the class for a few reasons. One being that if you work in web development and use nodejs
you will likely either be using npm or yarn for packages. This specific open source project is also very open
to beginners and contributors. If you look at the contributors, it is pretty diverse in the amount of contributors 
and the amount they have contributed. Furthermore, they are good at listing the opportunities for first timers to 
get involved. It's also not an overly large project, making it easier for someone to understand the repository
and contribute.

As stated earlier, there are plenty of contributions that can be made for first timers to this open source project.
A list of them can be found at https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/labels/good%20first%20issue . As expected, getting
a feel for a repository or project you aren't familiar with takes some time. However, there are available bug fixes
that will allow for a first time contributor to get up to date with the repo while still contributing. There are 
things such as trailing backslash breaks workspace features. After becoming more familiar with the project,
it would be possible to add more features. One such example would be having *yarn list* list the dependencies
of the current package, not all the packages within the workspace.

The github can be found at https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn and the website for yarn can be found at 
https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/ . Building the project is fairly easy. In order to do so, install nodejs first.
https://nodejs.org/en/ . After doing so, simply download the yarn installer on the website. This will then
install yarn on your computer. To ensure it was downloaded, run yarn --version in your terminal. It should list
the version.
